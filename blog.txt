<h1>Game Mechanics</h1>
<p>Minecraft is a multiplayer survival game 
  where the worlds are made out of blocks your 
  goal is to find items so you can craft stronger 
  weapons and armor so you can defeat the final 
  boss which is the ender dragon. The game is easy 
  to play and anyone at any age can get started with 
  playing it, they make the game more challenging by 
  having mobs spawn during the night and you must 
  either slay them or build a house that can protect 
  you from them. The ESRB rating for Minecraft is E 
  for everyone.

	The main way you get better at Minecraft is through 
  trial and error and just exploring all the different 
  things the game has to offer. Some specific strategies 
  I have are to build a simple house early in the game so 
  you have a safe place for when night arrives, another 
  tip I have is to try and find a cave early on because 
  they tend to have a lot of useful supplies you will need 
  in the game. Minecraft is a very easy game to start 
  playing because all the main mechanics and the main 
  idea of the game are very simple.</p>
