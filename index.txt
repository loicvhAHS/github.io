<h1>Minecraft</h1>
<p> Virtual Reality has come a long way since it was first 
introduced, Mark Zuckerberg calls the virtual world the metaverse 
and he has invested a lot of money into it. There have also been 
a lot more companies starting to sell their own VR headsets such as 
apple.

I believe that naturally virtual reality will get bigger and more popular 
as it advances through the years but, I believe it will be a while before 
it becomes typical to own a VR headset.
